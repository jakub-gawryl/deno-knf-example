# KNF Data retriver

This is my first example application that runs in [deno runtime](https://deno.land). It is written just for learning purposes.

Application retive CSV formatted data from [Short Selling Register provided by KNF](https://rss.knf.gov.pl/RssOuterView/faces/start2OuterView.xhtml) and displays on frontend page.

Tech:
- Plain HTML / CSS / JavaScript for front-end stuff
- [Deno Opine framework](https://deno.land/x/opine@2.3.3) (as replacement for `express` - web application framework known from node environment)
